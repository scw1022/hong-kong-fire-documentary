of people are dead after a massive fire in Hong Kong. Many people are still missing. The fire still isn’t out, and there’s no word on the cause, but many fingers are pointing to bamboo scaffolding that caused flames to spread very quickly.\nAnd: Ottawa announces support for steel and lumber industries coping with U.S. tariffs. The plan includes limits on the amount of foreign steel coming into the country, and measures to help steel and wood producers better compete in the domestic market.\nAlso: Canadian food banks are preparing to meet demand like never before. Grocery costs are soaring, and food banks say the need is pushing them past their limits.\nPlus: Two National Guards members shot near White House, the debate over F35s vs Gripens, challenges ahead for Paralympian Raphaëlle Tousignant, and more.","categories":[{"name":"Radio","slug":"radio"},{"name":"Your World

id="MainContentDescription">Dozens of people are dead after a massive fire in Hong Kong. Many people are still missing. The fire still isn’t out, and there’s no word on the cause, but many fingers are pointing to bamboo scaffolding that caused flames to spread very quickly.
And: Ottawa announces support for steel and lumber industries coping with U.S. tariffs. The plan includes limits on the amount of foreign steel coming into the country, and measures to help steel and wood producers better compete in the domestic market.
Also: Canadian food banks are preparing to meet demand like never before. Grocery costs are soaring, and food banks say the need is pushing them past their limits.
Plus: Two National Guards members shot near White House, the debate over F35s vs Gripens, challenges ahead for Paralympian Raphaëlle Tousignant, and more.</p></div><div
